# Promt for generating questions
```bashGenerate a CSV file of questions in the following format:
Columns: q,a,hint,options,category,lesson
- q: question text
- a: correct answer
- hint: a short hint or tip about the question
- options: a JSON array of options.
           For multiple-choice questions, options should always contain exactly 4 options (e.g., ["option1","option2","option3","option4"]).
           For yes/no questions, options should be ["yes","no"] and set a to "yes" or "no".
- category: [INSERT CATEGORY HERE] (I will provide this)
- lesson: 4 different lessons, each lesson contains 5 questions (total 20 questions)

Rules:
1. Questions should be related to the given category.
2. Mix simple yes/no questions and multiple-choice questions.
3. For yes/no questions, options should always be ["yes","no"].
4. For multiple-choice questions, options should always contain exactly 4 options.
5. Provide concise and helpful hints.
6. Ensure the CSV is **Supabase-compatible**:
   - Escape double quotes in JSON arrays by doubling them ("" inside outer quotes).
   - All fields containing commas must be enclosed in double quotes.
   - Each row must have exactly 6 fields.

Output: CSV format only, with headers included.

Example:

q,a,hint,options,category,lesson
"Is HTML a programming language?","no","HTML is a markup language, not a programming language","[""yes"",""no""]","web","HTML Basics"
"Does CSS change the style of a webpage?","yes","CSS is used to style HTML elements","[""yes"",""no""]","web","CSS Basics"
"Which HTML tag defines a paragraph?","<p>","Paragraph tag","[""<p>"",""<div>"",""<h1>"",""<span>""]","web","HTML Basics"

```
