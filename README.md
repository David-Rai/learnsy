# Promt for generating questions
```bash
Generate a CSV file of questions in the following format:
Columns: q,a,hint,options,category,lesson
- q: question text
- a: correct answer
- hint: a short hint or tip about the question
- options: an array of 4 options (e.g., ['option1','option2','option3','option4']). 
           If the question is yes/no type, use ['yes','no'] and set a to 'yes' or 'no'.
- category: [INSERT CATEGORY HERE] (I will provide this)
- lesson: 4 different lessons, each lesson contains 5 questions (total 20 questions)

Rules:
1. Questions should be related to the given category.
2. Mix simple yes/no questions and multiple-choice questions.
3. For yes/no questions, options should be ['yes','no'].
4. For multiple-choice questions, options should always contain exactly 4 options.
5. Provide hints that are concise and helpful.

Output: CSV format only, with headers included.

Example:

q,a,hint,options,category,lesson
"Is HTML a programming language?","no","HTML is a markup language, not a programming language","['yes','no']","web","HTML Basics"
"Does CSS change the style of a webpage?","yes","CSS is used to style HTML elements","['yes','no']","web","CSS Basics"
"Which HTML tag defines a paragraph?","<p>","Paragraph tag","['<p>','<div>','<h1>','<span>']","web","HTML Basics"
