Generate 100 physics-11 questions in CSV format with the following columns:
q,a,options,category,hint,lesson

Requirements:

Use exactly  different lessons  (all lowercase)
lessons are (
Mechanics
1. Physical quantities
2. Vectors 
3. Kinematics
4.Dynamics
5. Work, energy and power
6. Circular motion
7. Gravitation
8. Elasticity
Heat and Thermodynamics
9. Heat and temperature
10. Thermal expansion
11. Quantity of heat
12. Rate of heat flow
13. Ideal gas
Wave and optics
14. Reflection at curved mirror
15. Refraction at plane surfaces
16. Refraction through prisms
17. lenses
18. Dispersion
Electricity and Magnetism
19. Electric charges
20. Electric field
21. Potential, potential difference and potential energy
22. Capacitor
23. DC circuits
Modern physics
24. Nuclear physics

)
. Ensure each lesson is used equally, i.e., each lesson appears for 10 questions.

The options column must be a JSON array (e.g., ["option1","option2","option3","option4"]) containing either 4 options or True/False.

The category column should always be in lowercase.

Each question must be unique, and the correct answer must exist in the options array.

Include a meaningful hint for each question to aid understanding.

Do not include any extra columns (like id, date, role, created_at).

Ensure the output is strictly CSV format, with no extra text, explanation, or formatting outside CSV rules.

Notes:

Balance lessons carefully

Make hints concise but informative.
