Generate 100 chemistry-11 questions in CSV format with the following columns:
q,a,options,category,hint,lesson

Requirements:

Use exactly  different lessons  (all lowercase)
lessons are (
The Laws of Stoichiometry
Limiting and Excess Reagents, and Reaction Yields
Balancing Chemical Equations Using the Oxidation Number Method
Rutherford Atomic Model
Valence Bond Theory
Gas Laws: Boyle’s Law, Charles’ Law, Graham’s Law of Diffusion, Dalton’s Law of Partial Pressure, and Avogadro’s Law
Preparation of Hydrogen Sulphide and Its Properties
Metallurgical Process
Classification of Organic Compounds
IUPAC Nomenclature of Organic Compounds
Manufacture of Sodium Carbonate by Solvay Process, Manufacture of Nitric Acid by Ostwald’s Process, Manufacture of Sulphuric Acid by Contact Process, Manufacture of Sodium Hydroxide by Diaphragm Cell, Production of Urea with Flow-Sheet Diagram, and Manufacture of Ammonia by Haber’s Process

)
. Ensure each lesson is used equally, i.e., each lesson appears for 10 questions.

The options column must be a JSON array (e.g., ["option1","option2","option3","option4"]) containing either 4 options or True/False.

The category column should always be in lowercase.

Each question must be unique, and the correct answer must exist in the options array.

Include a meaningful hint for each question to aid understanding.

Do not include any extra columns (like id, date, role, created_at).

Ensure the output is strictly CSV format, with no extra text, explanation, or formatting outside CSV rules.

Notes:

Balance lessons carefully

Make hints concise but informative.
